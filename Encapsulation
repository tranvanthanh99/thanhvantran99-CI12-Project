-  Encapsulation is used to hide data members and members function

  +  Advantages of Encapsulation:

    ->>Data Hiding:     The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class.
                        It will not be visible to the user that how the class is storing values in the variables.
                        He only knows that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.

    ->>Increased Flexibility:   We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement.
                                If we wish to make the variables as read-only then we have to omit the setter methods like setName(), setAge() etc. from the above program
                                or if we wish to make the variables as write-only then we have to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge() etc. from the above program

    ->>Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.

    ->>Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.
